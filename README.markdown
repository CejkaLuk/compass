Compass is a sample android application which implements trivial compass functionality.
It was created just as a code snippet as it is required in most of my projects.

It going to be enhanced with:

1. better graphics
2. better animation
3. high frequency filter (High-pass filter) instead of stupid ignoring 49/50 sensor updates
