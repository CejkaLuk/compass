Compass is a sample android application which implements trivial compass functionality.
It was created just as a code snippet as it is required in most of my projects.

The main feature of the compass is noise filter (Low-pass filter) which make the arrow
more stable in comparison to other similar applications where arrow always trembles.

You can install it from google play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sevencrayons.compass

Enhancements are welcome!

Nearest changes:

* better, correct graphics
* customization of point to show
